# 🐵 Donkey Kong (ASCII Edition) - C++ OOP Project

Welcome to my **first Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project in C++ — a console-based recreation of the classic **Donkey Kong** game from 1981, entirely rendered with **ASCII characters** to preserve the retro charm of the original.

## 🎮 About the Game
This is a faithful, text-based adaptation of the arcade classic, where Mario (a.k.a. Jumpman) must rescue the damsel from the clutches of Donkey Kong, while avoiding barrels and other hazards — all in your terminal window!

## 💡 What I Learned

This project was a deep dive into fundamental **OOP concepts** in C++:

- **Encapsulation**: Managed the game's internal state by keeping data and logic separate, leading to better organization.
- **Inheritance**: Reused and extended game behavior across different game elements (e.g., characters, platforms, obstacles).
- **Polymorphism**: Allowed flexibility and scalability in object interactions, like different types of moving entities.
- **Modularity**: Designed clean, reusable, and maintainable components for rendering, input handling, and game mechanics.

## 🧱 Structure

The game was broken down into distinct classes such as:
- `Game` – The main game loop and state management
- `Character` – Base class for player and enemies
- `Player`, `DonkeyKong`, `Barrel` – Derived classes with specialized behavior
- `Map` – Handles level layout and rendering

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **C++** (Standard Libraries only)
- ASCII graphics via standard console output
- OOP principles for scalable design

## 📚 Key Takeaways

This project helped me:
- Strengthen my C++ programming skills
- Gain practical experience with OOP design patterns
- Understand how to build complex systems in a structured and scalable way
