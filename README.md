his is my first Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project in C++, where I have implemented the original Donkey Kong game from 1981.
The game runs in the console and is entirely represented using ASCII characters, staying true to the classic game's original aesthetic.
Throughout this project, I have had the opportunity to learn and apply key OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. 
By breaking down the game into modular, reusable components, I was able to create a more structured and maintainable codebase.
Encapsulation helped me manage the game's internal state, keeping the logic and data separate and improving the overall organization of the code.
This project has not only strengthened my understanding of C++ but also deepened my grasp of how OOP principles can be leveraged to design complex systems in a more efficient and scalable way.
